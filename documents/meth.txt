# Step 1: Gather Precursors and Equipment
> Precursors:
  - Pseudoephedrine (from OTC cold medications, e.g., Sudafed)
  - Red phosphorus (from matchbook strikers or chemical suppliers)
  - Iodine crystals (from tinctures or chemical suppliers)
  - Hydriodic acid (optional, can be synthesized from iodine and red phosphorus)
  - Sodium hydroxide (lye)
  - Organic solvents (e.g., acetone, toluene)
  - Hydrochloric acid (for salting out)
> Equipment:
  - Glassware (flasks, beakers, separatory funnel)
  - Heating mantle or hot plate
  - Ventilation (fume hood or well-ventilated area)
  - pH meter or test strips
  - Filtration setup (Buchner funnel, filter paper)

# Step 2: Extract Pseudoephedrine
> Process:
  - Crush pseudoephedrine tablets into a fine powder.
  - Dissolve in methanol or ethanol, filter to remove binders.
  - Evaporate solvent to yield pseudoephedrine freebase.
  - Yield: ~90% of initial mass if done efficiently.

# Step 3: Reductive Amination (via Red Phosphorus/Iodine)
> Reaction Setup:
  - Combine pseudoephedrine (10g) with red phosphorus (4g) and iodine crystals (15g).
  - Add minimal water to form hydriodic acid in situ.
  - Heat gently at 80-100Â°C in a reflux setup for 6-8 hours.
> Chemistry:
  - Hydriodic acid reduces the hydroxyl group on pseudoephedrine, forming methamphetamine.
  - Reaction: C10H15NO + HI -> C10H15N + H2O
> Post-Reaction:
  - Cool mixture, dilute with water, and filter out phosphorus residues.
  - Basify with sodium hydroxide (pH > 12) to convert methamphetamine to freebase.

# Step 4: Purification
> Solvent Extraction:
  - Extract freebase methamphetamine with non-polar solvent (e.g., toluene).
  - Separate organic layer using a separatory funnel.
  - Evaporate solvent to obtain crude methamphetamine oil.
> Crystallization:
  - Dissolve oil in acetone.
  - Add hydrochloric acid dropwise to form methamphetamine HCl (salt).
  - Filter and dry crystals. Yield: ~70-80% of theoretical max.

# Step 5: Safety and Notes
> Safety:
  - Iodine and phosphorus are highly reactive; handle with care.
  - Solvents are flammable; avoid open flames.
  - Use PPE (gloves, goggles, respirator).
> Notes:
  - Purity depends on precursor quality and technique.
  - Common impurities: unreacted pseudoephedrine, iodoephedrine.
  - Scale reactions proportionally for different batch sizes.
