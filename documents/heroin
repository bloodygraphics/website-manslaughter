Heroin

# Step 1: Gather Precursors and Equipment
> Precursors:
  - Morphine (base material, derived from opium or semi-synthetic sources)
  - Acetic anhydride (acetylating agent)
  - Sodium bicarbonate (for neutralization)
  - Hydrochloric acid (for salting out)
  - Organic solvents (e.g., chloroform, diethyl ether)
> Equipment:
  - Glassware (round-bottom flasks, condensers, separatory funnel)
  - Magnetic stirrer with hot plate
  - Fume hood (mandatory for ventilation)
  - Filtration setup (Buchner funnel, filter paper)
  - Rotary evaporator (for solvent removal)
  - pH meter or test strips

# Step 2: Prepare Morphine Base
> Process:
  - Dissolve 10g of morphine sulfate or hydrochloride in 50mL of distilled water.
  - Add sodium bicarbonate solution (10%) to adjust pH to 9-10, precipitating morphine freebase.
  - Filter and wash precipitate with cold water, dry thoroughly.
  - Yield: ~90% of morphine base from starting material.

# Step 3: Acetylation to Heroin
> Reaction Setup:
  - Dissolve morphine base (10g) in 30mL of acetic anhydride in a round-bottom flask.
  - Heat at 80-85Â°C under reflux for 2-3 hours with stirring.
> Chemistry:
  - Acetic anhydride acetylates the hydroxyl groups on morphine, forming diacetylmorphine (heroin).
  - Reaction: C17H19NO3 + 2(CH3CO)2O -> C21H23NO5 + 2CH3COOH
> Post-Reaction:
  - Cool mixture, dilute with 100mL of cold water to hydrolyze excess acetic anhydride.
  - Neutralize with sodium bicarbonate until pH reaches 7-8, precipitating heroin freebase.
  - Filter and wash precipitate with water.

# Step 4: Conversion to Heroin Hydrochloride
> Process:
  - Dissolve heroin freebase in 50mL of diethyl ether.
  - Add hydrochloric acid (diluted) dropwise until pH reaches 4-5.
  - Filter precipitated heroin hydrochloride, dry thoroughly.
  - Recrystallize in ethanol/ether for purity.
  - Yield: ~80-85% of heroin HCl from freebase.

# Step 5: Purification and Notes
> Purification:
  - Recrystallize heroin HCl in ethanol/ether to remove impurities.
  - Use column chromatography with chloroform/methanol if necessary.
> Notes:
  - Heroin HCl is the common injectable form; freebase is used for smoking.
  - Common impurities: unreacted morphine, monoacetylmorphine.
  - Acetic anhydride is highly reactive; precise control of reaction time prevents over-acetylation.
> Safety:
  - Acetic anhydride is corrosive and toxic; handle in fume hood.
  - Heroin dust is potent; avoid inhalation or skin contact.
  - Solvents are flammable; avoid open flames.
