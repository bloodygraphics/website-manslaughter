Krokodile

# Step 1: Gather Precursors and Equipment
> Precursors:
  - Codeine tablets (e.g., over-the-counter antitussives, 80-400mg codeine)
  - Iodine (from tincture of iodine disinfectant)
  - Red phosphorus (scraped from matchbox strike pads)
  - Hydrochloric acid (e.g., muriatic acid from hardware stores)
  - Sodium hydroxide (caustic soda, drain cleaner)
  - Organic solvent (e.g., gasoline, paint thinner, or lighter fluid)
> Equipment:
  - Heat-resistant glassware (e.g., Pyrex beaker or jar)
  - Heat source (stove, hot plate, or lighter)
  - Spoon or small metal container
  - Filtration setup (coffee filter or cloth)
  - Syringe (for final product, no purification)

# Step 2: Extract Codeine
> Process:
  - Crush 10-20 codeine tablets (containing 80-400mg codeine) into a fine powder.
  - Dissolve powder in 20mL of warm water (40-50°C).
  - Filter through coffee filter to remove insoluble fillers (e.g., paracetamol, starch).
  - Collect filtrate containing codeine.
  - Yield: ~80-90% of codeine from tablets.

# Step 3: Synthesize ?-Chlorocodide
> Reaction Setup:
  - Add iodine (2g) to codeine filtrate, stir to dissolve.
  - Add hydrochloric acid (5mL, diluted to 10%) to acidify (pH < 3).
  - Heat mixture at 70-80°C for 10-15 minutes with stirring.
> Chemistry:
  - Iodine and acid react with codeine to form ?-chlorocodide.
  - Reaction: C18H21NO3 + I2 + HCl -> C18H20ClNO2 + HI
> Post-Reaction:
  - Cool mixture; a brownish solution forms.
  - No purification; proceed to next step.

# Step 4: Reduction to Desomorphine
> Process:
  - Add red phosphorus (0.5g, scraped from matchboxes) to the ?-chlorocodide solution.
  - Add 10mL of organic solvent (e.g., gasoline or paint thinner).
  - Heat at 70-80°C for 20-30 minutes with stirring.
  - Add sodium hydroxide (10% solution) dropwise to neutralize (pH 7-8).
> Chemistry:
  - Red phosphorus and iodine reduce ?-chlorocodide to desomorphine via the Nagai method.
  - Reaction: C18H20ClNO2 + H2 -> C17H21NO2 + HCl
> Post-Reaction:
  - A light brown liquid forms, containing desomorphine and byproducts.
  - Filter through cloth to remove solid residues.
  - Yield: ~50-75% desomorphine, highly impure with toxic byproducts.

# Step 5: Final Preparation and Notes
> Preparation:
  - Collect the liquid (krokodil) in a syringe for injection; no further purification.
  - Product is a suspension with desomorphine (trace to 75%) and contaminants.
> Notes:
  - Krokodil is a crude mixture; toxic byproducts (e.g., iodine, phosphorus compounds) cause tissue damage.
  - Common impurities: unreacted codeine, chloro-intermediates, solvent residues.
  - Process takes 40-45 minutes; scaling increases impurity risks.
> Safety:
  - Iodine and red phosphorus are toxic; handle in well-ventilated area.
  - Solvents are flammable and toxic; avoid inhalation and open flames.
  - Acidic pH (< 3) in final product causes injection site damage.
