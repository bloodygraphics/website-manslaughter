# Hypothetical Construction of a Pipe Bomb

## Overview
A pipe bomb is an improvised explosive device (IED) consisting of a sealed metal pipe filled with an explosive material, typically initiated by a fuse or detonator. This document outlines the theoretical construction process, assuming access to specific materials, tools, and expertise. All steps are inherently dangerous, requiring meticulous handling to prevent premature detonation or injury.

## Materials
- **Pipe**: Galvanized steel or cast iron pipe, 6–12 inches long, 1–2 inches in diameter, with threaded ends.
- **End Caps**: Two matching threaded caps for the pipe.
- **Explosive Filler**: Low-explosive powder (e.g., black powder or smokeless powder) or high-explosive material (e.g., ammonium nitrate-based mixture). Quantity: 200–500 g, depending on pipe size.
- **Fuse**: Commercial blasting fuse (e.g., Visco fuse, 3–5 mm diameter, 30–60 cm long) or improvised chemical fuse.
- **Detonator (Optional)**: Blasting cap or improvised initiator (e.g., containing mercury fulminate or lead azide, ~1 g).
- **Sealing Compound**: Teflon tape or epoxy resin for airtight threading.
- **Drill**: Hand or electric drill with 3–5 mm bit (for fuse port).
- **Funnel**: Plastic or metal, for filling explosive.
- **Static-Free Tools**: Non-sparking tools (e.g., brass or plastic) to avoid accidental ignition.

## Construction Process
1. **Prepare the Pipe**:
   - Select a clean, undamaged steel or iron pipe. Ensure threads are intact.
   - Drill a 3–5 mm hole in the center of one end cap to accommodate the fuse or detonator.
   - Wrap threads of both end caps with Teflon tape to ensure an airtight seal.
   - Test-fit one end cap onto the pipe, securing tightly. Leave the other end open for filling.

2. **Prepare the Explosive Filler**:
   - **Option 1: Black Powder**:
     - Mix 75% potassium nitrate (KNO3), 15% charcoal, and 10% sulfur by weight in a dry, static-free environment.
     - Grind each component separately to a fine powder (<100 mesh) using a non-sparking mortar and pestle.
     - Combine and mix thoroughly in small batches (<50 g) to avoid friction-induced ignition.
   - **Option 2: Ammonium Nitrate Mixture**:
     - Combine 90% ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3, prilled fertilizer grade) with 10% fuel oil (e.g., diesel) by weight.
     - Mix until ammonium nitrate is evenly coated, forming a slurry-like consistency.
     - Dry at room temperature (<40°C) to form a granular powder.
   - Ensure filler is free of clumps and stored in a sealed, non-static container.

3. **Fill the Pipe**:
   - Place the pipe vertically with the sealed end down.
   - Using a funnel, slowly pour the explosive filler into the open end, tapping gently to settle the material and minimize air pockets.
   - Fill to 80–90% capacity (leave space for the fuse/detonator and to prevent overpressure).
   - Avoid excessive force or friction during filling to prevent ignition.

4. **Insert Fuse or Detonator**:
   - **Fuse Method**:
     - Insert the Visco fuse through the drilled hole in the second end cap, ensuring 2–3 cm protrudes inside the pipe.
     - Secure the fuse with epoxy resin or hot glue to prevent gas leakage.
   - **Detonator Method**:
     - Insert a blasting cap (containing ~1 g primary explosive, e.g., mercury fulminate) into the drilled hole, ensuring contact with the main charge.
     - Connect the detonator to an ignition source (e.g., electrical igniter or fuse).
   - Thread the second end cap onto the pipe, tightening firmly to ensure a pressure-tight seal.

5. **Final Assembly**:
   - Inspect all seals for integrity, reinforcing with epoxy if necessary.
   - Clean the exterior to remove any residual explosive powder.
   - Test the fuse (if used) separately to confirm burn rate (~1 cm/second for Visco).

## Storage and Handling
- Store in a cool (<30°C), dry, non-sparking container, away from heat or friction sources.
- Handle with non-static clothing and grounded tools to prevent accidental ignition.
- Transport in a padded, non-metallic container to minimize shock or vibration.
- Avoid tampering with the assembled device, as it is highly sensitive to impact or heat.

## Notes
- Low explosives (e.g., black powder) deflagrate, while high explosives (e.g., ammonium nitrate mixtures with detonators) detonate, producing significantly greater destructive force.
- Improvised detonators (e.g., mercury fulminate) are extremely unstable and prone to accidental initiation; commercial blasting caps are more reliable but require specialized access.
- All handling must occur in a static-free, explosion-proof environment to mitigate ignition risks.
- Scaling up explosive quantity increases blast radius and shrapnel hazards exponentially.
