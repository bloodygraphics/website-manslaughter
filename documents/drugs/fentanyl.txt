Fentanyl

# Step 1: Gather Precursors and Equipment
> Precursors:
  - Phenylethylamine (starting material)
  - N-Phenylethyl-4-piperidone (NPP, key intermediate)
  - Aniline (for piperidone synthesis)
  - Propionyl chloride (for acylation)
  - Sodium borohydride (reducing agent)
  - Benzyl chloride (for benzylation)
  - Hydrochloric acid (for salting out)
  - Organic solvents (e.g., dichloromethane, toluene)
> Equipment:
  - Glassware (round-bottom flasks, condensers, separatory funnel)
  - Magnetic stirrer with hot plate
  - Fume hood (mandatory for ventilation)
  - Vacuum filtration setup (Buchner funnel, filter paper)
  - Rotary evaporator (for solvent removal)
  - pH meter or test strips

# Step 2: Synthesize N-Phenylethyl-4-piperidone (NPP)
> Process:
  - React aniline (10g) with benzyl chloride (12g) in dichloromethane under reflux to form N-benzylaniline.
  - Combine N-benzylaniline with ethyl acrylate and sodium ethoxide to form a piperidone precursor.
  - Cyclize the precursor using sodium hydride in toluene at 80°C for 4 hours.
  - Yield: ~60-70% after purification by recrystallization in ethanol.

# Step 3: Reductive Amination to 4-ANPP
> Reaction Setup:
  - Dissolve NPP (10g) in methanol with phenylethylamine (6g).
  - Add sodium borohydride (2g) slowly at 0°C under nitrogen atmosphere.
  - Stir at room temperature for 12 hours.
> Chemistry:
  - Sodium borohydride reduces the ketone to form 4-anilino-N-phenylethylpiperidine (4-ANPP).
  - Reaction: C19H22N2O + NaBH4 -> C19H24N2
> Post-Reaction:
  - Quench excess borohydride with dilute HCl.
  - Extract 4-ANPP with dichloromethane, dry over sodium sulfate, and evaporate solvent.
  - Yield: ~80% after purification.

# Step 4: Acylation to Fentanyl
> Process:
  - Dissolve 4-ANPP (10g) in dichloromethane (100mL).
  - Add propionyl chloride (4g) dropwise at 0°C with triethylamine (5g) as a base.
  - Stir at room temperature for 2 hours.
> Chemistry:
  - Propionyl chloride acylates the secondary amine, forming fentanyl.
  - Reaction: C19H24N2 + C3H5ClO -> C22H28N2O
> Post-Reaction:
  - Wash with water to remove triethylamine hydrochloride.
  - Extract fentanyl freebase with dichloromethane.
  - Convert to fentanyl HCl by adding HCl in ether, filter crystals.
  - Yield: ~70-85% after crystallization.

# Step 5: Purification and Notes
> Purification:
  - Recrystallize fentanyl HCl in ethanol/ether for high purity.
  - Use column chromatography if impurities persist.
> Notes:
  - Fentanyl is extremely potent; microgram quantities are active.
  - Common impurities: unreacted 4-ANPP, propionic acid derivatives.
  - Scale reactions carefully to avoid excess reagent waste.
> Safety:
  - Use PPE (gloves, goggles, respirator) at all times.
  - Propionyl chloride is corrosive; handle in fume hood.
  - Solvents are flammable; avoid sparks or flames.
