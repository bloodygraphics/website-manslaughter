Crack

# Step 1: Gather Materials and Equipment
> Materials:
  - Cocaine hydrochloride (powder cocaine)
  - Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)
  - Distilled water
  - Heat-resistant glassware (e.g., Pyrex beaker)
> Equipment:
  - Heat source (stove, hot plate, or lighter)
  - Spoon or small metal container
  - Filter paper or fine mesh (optional for purification)
  - Razor blade or knife (for cutting final product)

# Step 2: Prepare Cocaine Solution
> Process:
  - Measure 1g of cocaine hydrochloride.
  - Dissolve in 3-5mL of distilled water in a heat-resistant glassware or spoon.
  - Stir until fully dissolved to form a clear solution.

# Step 3: Add Base and Heat
> Reaction Setup:
  - Add 0.3-0.5g of sodium bicarbonate to the cocaine solution.
  - Gently heat the mixture (50-70°C) on a hot plate or over a flame.
  - Stir continuously until the solution becomes cloudy and oily droplets form.
> Chemistry:
  - Sodium bicarbonate neutralizes the hydrochloride, converting cocaine HCl to freebase cocaine.
  - Reaction: C17H21NO4·HCl + NaHCO3 -> C17H21NO4 + NaCl + H2O + CO2
> Observation:
  - Oily droplets solidify into waxy or rock-like chunks as the freebase precipitates.

# Step 4: Cool and Collect
> Process:
  - Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature.
  - Collect the solid crack cocaine chunks from the surface or filter through fine mesh.
  - Rinse with cold distilled water to remove residual sodium bicarbonate or salt.
  - Dry thoroughly at room temperature or with gentle heat.
  - Yield: ~80-90% of starting cocaine mass.

# Step 5: Purification and Notes
> Purification:
  - Cut or crush dried crack into smaller pieces for consistency.
  - Optional: Wash with acetone to remove impurities, then dry again.
> Notes:
  - Crack is the freebase form of cocaine, suitable for smoking.
  - Impurities may include unreacted cocaine HCl or excess bicarbonate.
  - Adjust water and bicarbonate ratios for larger batches (e.g., 1:3 cocaine-to-water, 1:0.4 cocaine-to-bicarbonate).
> Safety:
  - Cocaine is caustic; avoid skin contact.
  - Heating flammable solvents like acetone requires caution; use fume hood if washing.
  - Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.
