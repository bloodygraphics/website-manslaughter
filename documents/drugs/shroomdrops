# Hypothetical Preparation of Psilocybin Mushroom Tincture Drops

## Overview
Psilocybin mushroom tincture drops are a concentrated liquid extract of psilocybin and psilocin, psychoactive compounds found in Psilocybe mushrooms (e.g., Psilocybe cubensis). This method uses high-proof alcohol to extract these compounds from dried mushrooms, creating a potent solution for sublingual (under-the-tongue) administration. The process targets a small batch suitable for precise dosing, with 1 mL of tincture roughly equivalent to 2 grams of dried mushrooms. All steps involve handling controlled, psychoactive substances and flammable solvents, requiring extreme caution in a controlled environment to prevent degradation, contamination, or accidents.

## Materials
- **Precursor Materials**:
  - Dried Psilocybe mushrooms (e.g., Psilocybe cubensis): 2 g (younger mushrooms preferred for higher psilocybin content).
  - High-proof alcohol (e.g., 190-proof Everclear or 100-proof vodka, minimum 40% alcohol by volume): 20–30 mL for extraction.
- **Other Materials**:
  - Distilled water (optional): 5–10 mL to dilute alcohol to ~50% for optimal extraction.
  - Activated charcoal (optional): 0.5–1 g for purification (if clarity is desired).
- **Equipment**:
  - Glass jar (50–100 mL) with a leak-proof lid for extraction.
  - Coffee grinder or mortar and pestle (for pulverizing mushrooms).
  - Fine mesh strainer, cheesecloth, or coffee filter (for filtration).
  - Funnel (small, for transferring liquid).
  - Amber glass dropper bottles (10–30 mL capacity) for storage.
  - Protective gear: Nitrile gloves, safety goggles, non-static clothing.
  - Ventilation setup: Fume hood or well-ventilated area (to handle alcohol vapors).
- **Optional**:
  - Precision scale (for accurate mushroom measurement).
  - pH test strips (to monitor solution if adjustments are needed).
  - High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for potency analysis (unlikely in home settings).

## Preparation Process
1. **Prepare Dried Mushrooms**:
   - Select 2 g of dried Psilocybe mushrooms (caps contain slightly higher psilocybin than stems). Ensure mushrooms are fully dehydrated, as fresh mushrooms have lower stability and may degrade during extraction.[](https://www.trufflemagic.com/simple-method-psilocybin-extraction/)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/9m7nwg/nice_shroom_tincture/)
   - Pulverize the mushrooms into a fine powder using a coffee grinder or mortar and pestle to maximize surface area for extraction. Place the powder in a clean, dry 50–100 mL glass jar.

2. **Extract Psilocybin with Alcohol**:
   - Add 20 mL high-proof alcohol (e.g., 190-proof Everclear or 100-proof vodka) to the jar with mushroom powder, ensuring the powder is fully submerged but not overly saturated (aim for ~1 g mushrooms per 10 mL alcohol). Optionally, dilute with 5–10 mL distilled water to achieve ~50% alcohol by volume for better psilocybin solubility, as psilocybin is water-soluble and less stable in pure ethanol.[](https://mycotopia.net/topic/83518-psilocybin-mushroom-tincture/)
   - Seal the jar tightly and shake vigorously for 5–10 minutes to mix thoroughly.
   - Store the jar in a cool, dark place (e.g., a pantry or refrigerator at ~4–10°C) for 1–2 weeks to allow psilocybin and psilocin to leach into the alcohol. Shake the jar daily for 30–60 seconds to enhance extraction. Avoid direct sunlight or high temperatures, as psilocybin degrades under light and heat.[](https://www.zamnesia.com/blog-mushroom-drops-comprehensive-guide-n3098)[](https://www.zamnesia.com/us/blog-mushroom-drops-comprehensive-guide-n3098)

3. **Strain the Tincture**:
   - After 1–2 weeks, filter the mixture through a fine mesh strainer, cheesecloth, or coffee filter into a clean glass container, using a funnel to avoid spills. Press the mushroom residue to extract all liquid.
   - Optionally, treat the filtered liquid with 0.5 g activated charcoal to remove impurities or discoloration, then filter again for clarity. This step is cosmetic and may slightly reduce potency.
   - The resulting tincture should be a clear to cloudy liquid with a pungent, earthy aroma. Expected yield: ~15–20 mL tincture, with ~1 mL equivalent to ~2 g dried mushrooms (potency varies by mushroom species and strain).[](https://www.zamnesia.com/blog-mushroom-drops-comprehensive-guide-n3098)[](https://www.trufflemagic.com/simple-method-psilocybin-extraction/)

4. **Bottle and Store**:
   - Transfer the tincture into amber glass dropper bottles (10–30 mL) using a funnel to minimize light exposure, which degrades psilocybin.[](https://www.zamnesia.com/blog-mushroom-drops-comprehensive-guide-n3098)[](https://www.zamnesia.com/us/blog-mushroom-drops-comprehensive-guide-n3098)
   - Store bottles in a cool, dark place (e.g., refrigerator at ~4°C) to maintain potency for several months. Shake gently before each use to disperse any sediment or polysaccharides.[](https://www.mushroomrevival.com/blogs/blog/how-to-make-mushroom-tincture)

## Usage and Dosing
- **Administration**: Place 1–2 drops under the tongue and hold for 30–60 seconds before swallowing for sublingual absorption, which bypasses the digestive tract for faster onset. Alternatively, add drops to a beverage (e.g., water, juice) to mask the bitter taste, though this may slow absorption.[](https://cannadelics.com/2022/04/11/magic-mushroom-tinctures-what-they-are-and-how-to-make-them/)[](https://balancecoffee.co.uk/collections/mushroom-tincture-drops)
- **Dosing**: Start with 1 drop (~0.05 mL, equivalent to ~0.1 g dried mushrooms) to assess potency and personal tolerance, as mushroom potency varies (0.5–1.8% psilocybin by dry weight). Gradually increase in subsequent sessions if needed, but do not exceed 0.5 mL (10 drops, ~1 g dried mushrooms) without experience. Use in a safe, controlled environment with a trusted person present.[](https://www.zamnesia.com/blog-mushroom-drops-comprehensive-guide-n3098)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/9m7nwg/nice_shroom_tincture/)
- **Potency Note**: Without lab testing (e.g., HPLC), exact psilocybin concentration is unknown. Assume ~1 mL = 2 g dried mushrooms and adjust cautiously.[](https://doubleblindmag.com/mushroom-tinctures/)

## Storage and Handling
- Store tincture in amber glass dropper bottles in a refrigerator (~4°C) or cool, dark place to prevent psilocybin degradation. Properly stored, the tincture remains potent for 6–12 months.[](https://www.zamnesia.com/blog-mushroom-drops-comprehensive-guide-n3098)[](https://www.zamnesia.com/us/blog-mushroom-drops-comprehensive-guide-n3098)
- Handle with nitrile gloves and safety goggles to avoid skin contact with alcohol or accidental ingestion. Use in a well-ventilated area to minimize inhalation of alcohol vapors.
- Keep bottles sealed and away from children or unauthorized access, as psilocybin is a controlled substance in most regions.

## Notes
- **Purity**: Home-made tinctures are typically 90–95% pure, with potential impurities like plant matter or polysaccharides. Lab-grade psilocybin requires advanced purification (e.g., chromatography), not feasible at home.[](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/18/3/380)
- **Hazards**: Psilocybin can cause intense psychological effects, including hallucinations, anxiety, or panic. Alcohol is flammable; avoid open flames. Work in a fume hood or well-ventilated area to manage vapors.[](https://www.zamnesia.com/blog-mushroom-drops-comprehensive-guide-n3098)
- **Efficiency**: Yield is ~70–80% of psilocybin content due to incomplete extraction. Potency depends on mushroom species (e.g., Psilocybe cubensis: 0.6–1.8% psilocybin) and drying conditions.[](https://www.trufflemagic.com/simple-method-psilocybin-extraction/)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/9m7nwg/nice_shroom_tincture/)
- **Scale**: This process targets a small batch (~15–20 mL) for personal use. Scaling up increases risks and regulatory scrutiny.
- **Precursor Control**: Psilocybin mushrooms are illegal in most regions (e.g., Schedule I in the U.S.), and possession or processing may violate local laws. Verify legal status before attempting.[](https://www.zamnesia.com/blog-mushroom-drops-comprehensive-guide-n3098)[](https://www.ybspackaging.com/blog/magic-mushroom-tincture-boxes-labels-2021-guide)
- **Verification**: Without HPLC, rely on visual inspection (cloudy liquid with earthy odor) or test dosing (start low). Melting point tests (~220–228°C for psilocybin) are impractical at home.[](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/18/3/380)
- **Appearance**: Tincture is a clear to cloudy, amber to brown liquid, often with fine sediment (polysaccharides).[](https://www.mushroomrevival.com/blogs/blog/how-to-make-mushroom-tincture)
