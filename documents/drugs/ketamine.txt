Ketamine

# Step 1: Gather Precursors and Equipment
> Precursors:
  - Cyclopentanone (starting material)
  - Methylamine (for imine formation)
  - 2-Chlorobenzonitrile (for aryl component)
  - Magnesium turnings (for Grignard reagent)
  - Bromine (for bromination)
  - Sodium hydroxide (for base reactions)
  - Hydrochloric acid (for salting out)
  - Organic solvents (e.g., diethyl ether, dichloromethane)
> Equipment:
  - Glassware (round-bottom flasks, condensers, separatory funnel)
  - Magnetic stirrer with hot plate
  - Fume hood (mandatory for ventilation)
  - Vacuum distillation setup
  - Filtration setup (Buchner funnel, filter paper)
  - Rotary evaporator (for solvent removal)

# Step 2: Synthesize 1-Hydroxycyclopentyl-(2-chlorophenyl)-ketone
> Process:
  - React cyclopentanone (10g) with bromine (12g) in dichloromethane at 0°C to form 2-bromocyclopentanone.
  - Prepare Grignard reagent from 2-chlorobenzonitrile (15g) and magnesium (2.5g) in dry ether.
  - Add 2-bromocyclopentanone to Grignard reagent, stir at room temperature for 4 hours.
  - Hydrolyze with dilute HCl to form 1-hydroxycyclopentyl-(2-chlorophenyl)-ketone.
  - Yield: ~65-75% after purification by vacuum distillation.

# Step 3: Form Imine with Methylamine
> Reaction Setup:
  - Dissolve 1-hydroxycyclopentyl-(2-chlorophenyl)-ketone (10g) in methanol (50mL).
  - Add methylamine (5g, 40% aqueous solution) and stir at 40°C for 6 hours.
> Chemistry:
  - Methylamine reacts with the ketone to form an imine intermediate.
  - Reaction: C12H13ClO2 + CH3NH2 -> C13H16ClNO + H2O
> Post-Reaction:
  - Evaporate methanol under reduced pressure.
  - Extract imine with dichloromethane, dry over sodium sulfate.
  - Yield: ~80% after solvent removal.

# Step 4: Thermal Rearrangement to Ketamine
> Process:
  - Heat imine (10g) in decalin (50mL) at 180-190°C for 3 hours under nitrogen.
  - Rearrangement forms ketamine via a cyclization and dehydration mechanism.
> Chemistry:
  - Imine undergoes thermal rearrangement to form the arylcyclohexylamine structure.
  - Reaction: C13H16ClNO -> C13H16ClNO (isomerized)
> Post-Reaction:
  - Cool mixture, dilute with ether, and extract with dilute HCl.
  - Basify aqueous layer with sodium hydroxide (pH > 12) to liberate ketamine freebase.
  - Extract freebase with dichloromethane, evaporate solvent.
  - Convert to ketamine HCl by adding HCl in ether, filter crystals.
  - Yield: ~60-70% after crystallization.

# Step 5: Purification and Notes
> Purification:
  - Recrystallize ketamine HCl in ethanol/ether for high purity.
  - Use column chromatography if impurities (e.g., unreacted imine) persist.
> Notes:
  - Ketamine HCl is the common powder form; freebase is oily.
  - Common impurities: unreacted ketone, methylamine salts.
  - Scale reactions proportionally for larger batches.
> Safety:
  - Bromine is highly corrosive; handle in fume hood.
  - Grignard reagents are pyrophoric; use dry conditions.
  - Solvents are flammable; avoid open flames.
