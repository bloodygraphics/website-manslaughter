# Hypothetical Production of Codeine

## Overview
Codeine (methylmorphine, C18H21NO3) is an opioid alkaloid found in opium (0.7–2.5% by weight) derived from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). It is primarily produced by extracting morphine from opium and methylating it to form codeine, or by direct extraction of codeine from opium. This document outlines two theoretical processes: (1) extraction of codeine from opium, and (2) semi-synthesis from morphine. Both methods require access to controlled raw materials, hazardous chemicals, and specialized laboratory equipment. All steps are highly dangerous, involving toxic, flammable, and corrosive substances, and demand meticulous handling in a controlled environment to prevent poisoning, fires, or chemical accidents.

## Materials
- **Raw Materials**:
  - Option 1 (Extraction): Dried opium latex (from Papaver somniferum), 10–20 kg (yields ~70–500 g codeine, depending on alkaloid content).
  - Option 2 (Synthesis): Morphine base or morphine hydrochloride, 1 kg (yields ~0.9–0.95 kg codeine).
- **Chemicals**:
  - Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2): 5–10 kg for alkaloid liberation.
  - Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl): 2–5 kg for precipitation.
  - Chloroform or toluene: 20–50 L for extraction.
  - Methanol or ethanol: 10–20 L for recrystallization.
  - Dimethyl sulfate ((CH3)2SO4) or methyl iodide (CH3I): 0.5–1 L for methylation (synthesis route).
  - Sodium hydroxide (NaOH): 2–5 kg for pH adjustment.
  - Hydrochloric acid (HCl, concentrated): 2–5 L for hydrochloride formation.
- **Equipment**:
  - Large stainless steel or glass containers (20–50 L, acid-resistant).
  - Industrial strainer or fine mesh for filtration.
  - Separatory funnel (5–10 L) for liquid-liquid extraction.
  - Rotary evaporator or distillation setup (for solvent recovery).
  - Fume hood (explosion-proof, for handling volatile and toxic chemicals).
  - Heating lamps or hot plate (for drying, <80°C).
  - pH meter or test strips (to monitor acidity/alkalinity).
  - Stirring rods (non-sparking, e.g., glass or plastic).
  - Protective gear: Acid-resistant gloves, goggles, respirator, non-static clothing.
- **Optional (for Purification)**:
  - Activated charcoal: 0.5–1 kg for impurity removal.
  - High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system for analytical-grade purity.

## Production Process
### Option 1: Extraction of Codeine from Opium
1. **Prepare Opium**:
   - Collect 10–20 kg dried opium latex from incised Papaver somniferum seed pods. Source: Regions like Afghanistan, Myanmar, or Mexico (illicit cultivation areas).
   - Pulverize opium into a fine powder to increase surface area for extraction.

2. **Extract Alkaloids**:
   - Dissolve opium powder in 20–40 L warm water (40–50°C) with 5–10 kg calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) to form a slurry. Stir for 2–4 hours to liberate alkaloids (morphine, codeine, thebaine) as soluble calcium salts (pH ~10–11).
   - Filter through a fine mesh or cloth to remove plant residue, retaining the aqueous alkaloid solution.
   - Add 2–5 kg ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) to the filtrate to precipitate alkaloids as free bases. Stir for 1–2 hours.
   - Filter the precipitate (mixed alkaloids: morphine, codeine, thebaine) and dry under heating lamps (<60°C) for 12–24 hours. Yield: ~1–2 kg crude alkaloids per 10 kg opium.

3. **Separate Codeine**:
   - Dissolve crude alkaloids in 10–20 L chloroform or toluene in a fume hood (volatile and toxic solvents).
   - Perform liquid-liquid extraction by adding 5–10 L water and adjusting pH to 8–9 with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Codeine (more soluble in organic solvents than morphine) partitions into the chloroform/toluene layer.
   - Separate the organic layer using a separatory funnel and evaporate solvent using a rotary evaporator (<60°C) to yield crude codeine base.
   - Recrystallize codeine base in 5–10 L methanol or ethanol to improve purity. Filter and dry crystals (<60°C). Yield: ~70–500 g codeine base per 10 kg opium, depending on alkaloid content (0.7–2.5%).

4. **Form Codeine Hydrochloride or Phosphate**:
   - Dissolve codeine base in 5–10 L methanol with 1–2 L hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form codeine hydrochloride. For pharmaceutical-grade codeine phosphate, use phosphoric acid (H3PO4) instead.
   - Evaporate solvent under vacuum to crystallize codeine salt.
   - Dry under heating lamps (<50°C) for 6–12 hours. Yield: ~60–450 g codeine hydrochloride/phosphate, ~80–90% purity.

### Option 2: Semi-Synthesis from Morphine
1. **Acquire Morphine**:
   - Start with 1 kg morphine base or morphine hydrochloride, typically extracted from opium (see extraction steps above) or sourced from pharmaceutical intermediates.
   - Dissolve morphine in 5–10 L methanol or ethanol to form a solution.

2. **Methylation of Morphine**:
   - In a fume hood, add 0.5–1 L dimethyl sulfate ((CH3)2SO4) or methyl iodide (CH3I) dropwise to the morphine solution while stirring at 40–50°C. Dimethyl sulfate is highly toxic and carcinogenic; handle with extreme care.
   - Maintain pH ~8–9 with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to facilitate O-methylation at the phenolic hydroxyl group of morphine, forming codeine.
   - Stir for 4–6 hours, monitoring reaction completion via thin-layer chromatography (TLC) if available.
   - Neutralize excess methylating agent with additional NaOH, then extract codeine into 10–20 L chloroform or toluene using a separatory funnel.

3. **Purify Codeine Base**:
   - Evaporate the organic solvent (<60°C) using a rotary evaporator to yield crude codeine base.
   - Recrystallize in 5–10 L methanol or ethanol to remove impurities. Optionally, treat with 0.5–1 kg activated charcoal before recrystallization for higher purity.
   - Filter and dry codeine base crystals (<60°C). Yield: ~0.9–0.95 kg codeine base per 1 kg morphine.

4. **Form Codeine Hydrochloride or Phosphate**:
   - Dissolve codeine base in 5–10 L methanol with 1–2 L hydrochloric acid (HCl) for codeine hydrochloride or phosphoric acid (H3PO4) for codeine phosphate.
   - Evaporate solvent under vacuum to crystallize the salt.
   - Dry under heating lamps (<50°C) for 6–12 hours. Yield: ~0.85–0.9 kg codeine hydrochloride/phosphate, ~90–95% purity.

## Storage and Handling
- Store codeine hydrochloride or phosphate in airtight, non-static, light-resistant containers in a cool (<25°C), dry environment to prevent degradation.
- Handle with acid-resistant gloves, goggles, respirators, and non-static clothing to avoid inhalation, chemical burns, or accidental ignition of flammable solvents.
- Transport in sealed, padded containers to minimize shock or exposure to moisture.
- Avoid open flames or sparks near solvents (e.g., chloroform, methanol) due to high flammability.

## Notes
- **Purity**: Pharmaceutical-grade codeine is ~95–99% pure, achieved via HPLC or multiple recrystallizations. Illicit production typically yields 80–90% purity due to impurities like morphine or thebaine.
- **Hazards**: Dimethyl sulfate and methyl iodide are highly toxic and carcinogenic; chloroform and toluene are volatile and neurotoxic. Work in an explosion-proof fume hood with robust ventilation.
- **Efficiency**: Extraction from opium yields low codeine quantities (0.7–2.5% of opium weight) due to higher morphine content (10–16%). Semi-synthesis from morphine is more efficient, with ~90% conversion to codeine.
- **Scale**: Industrial production uses large-scale extraction from opium poppies in licensed facilities (e.g., in India, Turkey). Illicit labs are less controlled, increasing risks of contamination or accidents.
- **Byproducts**: Thebaine and morphine co-extracted from opium can be further processed into other opioids (e.g., oxycodone, heroin), but require additional chemical steps.
- **Analytical Verification**: Use TLC, HPLC, or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to confirm codeine purity and absence of toxic impurities.
