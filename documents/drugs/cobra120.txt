Hypothetical Production of Cobra 120 (Sildenafil Citrate) 120 mg
Overview
Cobra 120 is an unlicensed erectile dysfunction treatment, primarily marketed as containing sildenafil citrate (C22H30N6O4S·C6H8O7), a PDE5 inhibitor that enhances blood flow to the penis to facilitate erections. This document outlines a theoretical process for synthesizing sildenafil citrate, starting from 3-propylpyrazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, through methylation, hydrolysis, chlorosulfonation, condensation, and citrate salt formation, followed by preparation into 120 mg doses (powder or tablets). The process targets a small-scale batch of ~1.2 kg sildenafil citrate (sufficient for ~10,000 doses). All steps are highly dangerous, involving toxic, flammable, and corrosive substances, and demand meticulous handling in a controlled laboratory environment to prevent poisoning, fires, or chemical accidents.

Production Process
Synthesis of Sildenafil Citrate from 3-Propylpyrazole-5-Carboxylic Acid Ethyl Ester

Prepare Precursor:

Acquire 1.9 kg 3-propylpyrazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, typically sourced from chemical suppliers or pharmaceutical intermediates.
Verify purity using HPLC or thin-layer chromatography (TLC) if available (>95% purity target).


Methylation:

Dissolve 1.9 kg 3-propylpyrazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester in 20–30 L methanol in a 50 L glass or stainless steel container under a fume hood. Stir for 1–2 hours at 25–30°C to ensure complete dissolution.
Add 1.0–1.4 kg dimethyl sulfate dropwise while stirring, maintaining temperature at 60–70°C. Heat under reflux for 4–6 hours to methylate the pyrazole ring. Dimethyl sulfate is highly toxic and carcinogenic; handle with extreme care.
Monitor reaction progress via TLC (Rf ~0.5 in 9:1 dichloromethane:methanol). Cool to room temperature.


Hydrolysis:

Add 10–15 L aqueous sodium hydroxide (2M) to the reaction mixture and heat to 80°C for 2–3 hours to hydrolyze the ethyl ester to the free acid.
Cool to room temperature and adjust pH to ~2–3 with concentrated HCl to precipitate the acid intermediate. Filter through a fine mesh and dry under heating lamps (<60°C) for 12–24 hours.


Chlorosulfonation and Condensation:

Dissolve the acid intermediate in 10–20 L DCM under a fume hood. Add 1.2–1.8 kg chlorosulfonic acid dropwise at 0–5°C (ice bath) with stirring to form the sulfonyl chloride. Stir for 2–3 hours.
Add 1.0–1.2 kg 1-methylpiperazine dissolved in 5–10 L DCM with 5–10 L triethylamine to neutralize acid byproducts. Stir at 25–30°C for 4–6 hours to condense, forming sildenafil base.
Monitor reaction progress via TLC (Rf ~0.7 in 9:1 dichloromethane:methanol). Add 10–20 L water and adjust pH to ~7–8 with NaOH.


Extract Sildenafil:

Transfer the reaction mixture to a 10 L separatory funnel and extract with 10–20 L DCM. Shake gently and allow layers to separate.
Collect the DCM layer containing sildenafil and repeat extraction with an additional 10 L DCM. Combine organic layers.
Dry the DCM solution with 5–10 kg anhydrous MgSO4 for 1–2 hours, then filter through a fine mesh.
Evaporate DCM using a rotary evaporator (<60°C) to yield crude sildenafil (~1.0–1.3 kg).


Form Sildenafil Citrate and Purify:

Dissolve crude sildenafil in 10–20 L hot methanol (60°C). Add 1.0–1.2 kg citric acid dissolved in 5 L methanol, stirring for 1–2 hours to form sildenafil citrate.
Cool the solution slowly to room temperature, then chill at 4°C for 4–6 hours to recrystallize sildenafil citrate.
Filter crystals through a fine mesh and wash with 5–10 L cold acetone to remove impurities. Optionally, add 0.5–1 kg activated charcoal during recrystallization to remove colored impurities, then filter while hot.
Dry under heating lamps (<60°C) for 12–24 hours. Yield: ~1.0–1.2 kg sildenafil citrate, ~90–95% purity.


Prepare 120 mg Doses:

Pulverize sildenafil citrate crystals into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or industrial grinder.
Weigh ~1.2 kg sildenafil citrate and divide into ~10,000 portions of 120 mg each using an analytical balance for precision.
For Powder: Package 120 mg portions into airtight, light-resistant containers (e.g., amber vials).
For Tablets (Optional): Blend 1.2 kg sildenafil citrate with 0.5–1 kg microcrystalline cellulose and 0.1–0.2 kg magnesium stearate. Load into a tablet press with a 6–8 mm die to form 10,000 tablets, each containing 120 mg sildenafil citrate (130–140 mg total weight with filler). Yield: ~10,000 tablets.



Storage and Handling

Store sildenafil citrate in airtight, non-static, light-resistant containers in a cool (<25°C), dry environment to prevent degradation.
Handle with acid-resistant gloves, goggles, full-face respirators, and non-static clothing to avoid inhalation, chemical burns, or accidental ignition of flammable solvents.
Transport in sealed, padded containers to minimize shock or exposure to moisture.
Avoid open flames or sparks near solvents (e.g., methanol, DCM, acetone) due to high flammability.

Notes

Purity: Pharmaceutical-grade sildenafil citrate is ~95–99% pure, achieved via HPLC or multiple recrystallizations. Illicit production, like Cobra 120, typically yields 90–95% purity due to residual precursors or solvent traces. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7145790/]
Hazards: Dimethyl sulfate and chlorosulfonic acid are highly toxic and corrosive; methanol, DCM, and acetone are flammable and toxic. Work in an explosion-proof fume hood with robust ventilation. Sildenafil poses risks of side effects like priapism, hypotension, or vision changes, especially with inconsistent dosing or interactions with nitrates. [https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/prescription-drugs]
Efficiency: Yield is ~60–70% due to losses during extraction and recrystallization. High-purity precursors and precise reaction control maximize recovery.
Scale: This process targets ~1.2 kg sildenafil citrate for ~10,000 doses at 120 mg, suitable for small-scale hypothetical production. Industrial-scale synthesis requires licensed facilities due to regulatory controls.
Byproducts: Trace 3-propylpyrazole intermediates or sulfonation byproducts may remain, removable via additional recrystallization or HPLC purification.
Analytical Verification: Use TLC, HPLC, or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to confirm sildenafil purity and absence of toxic impurities.
Precursor Control: Sildenafil and its precursors are controlled in many regions (e.g., Schedule IV in some jurisdictions, monitored by U.S. DEA, UN 1971 Convention). Dimethyl sulfate and chlorosulfonic acid are monitored in bulk. Illicit sourcing is common in hypothetical scenarios, but Cobra 120 is unlicensed in the UK and EU, posing risks of counterfeits or inconsistent dosing.
