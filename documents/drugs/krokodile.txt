# Hypothetical Synthesis of Krokodil (Desomorphine)

## Overview
Krokodil, street name for desomorphine (4,5-α-epoxy-17-methylmorphinan-3-ol or dihydrodesoxymorphine), is a semi-synthetic opioid derived from codeine, used as a cheap, highly addictive substitute for heroin. The synthesis mimics crude, homemade methods prevalent in Russia and Ukraine, involving reduction of codeine using toxic reagents like iodine and red phosphorus. The process is rapid but produces an impure, highly toxic mixture due to unrefined reactants and byproducts. This document outlines the theoretical synthesis process, assuming access to over-the-counter codeine, household chemicals, and basic equipment. All steps are extremely hazardous, involving highly toxic, corrosive, and flammable substances, and demand meticulous handling to prevent poisoning, fires, or explosions. The resulting product causes severe tissue damage, necrosis, and systemic toxicity.

## Materials
- **Precursor Chemicals**:
  - Codeine tablets (over-the-counter, containing 8–30 mg codeine per tablet): 100–500 tablets (80–400 mg codeine total).
  - Iodine (from disinfectants or tinctures): 50–100 g for reduction.
  - Red phosphorus (scraped from matchbox striker surfaces): 10–50 g for reduction.
- **Other Chemicals**:
  - Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, caustic soda or lye): 100–500 g for codeine extraction and pH adjustment.
  - Hydrochloric acid (HCl, concentrated, ~37%): 100–500 mL for acidification and salt formation.
  - Gasoline, paint thinner, or ethyl acetate: 1–5 L as organic solvent for extraction.
  - Acetone: 500 mL–1 L for washing impurities.
  - Sodium bicarbonate (optional): 50–100 g for pH neutralization attempts.
  - Ethanol (optional): 500 mL–1 L for tablet extraction.
- **Equipment**:
  - Glass or metal reaction vessel (1–5 L, corrosion-resistant).
  - Hot plate or stove (for heating, <100°C).
  - Glass stirring rod or metal spoon (non-reactive).
  - Funnel and filter paper (for crude filtration).
  - Syringes (1–10 mL) for injection (non-sterile in illicit settings).
  - Measuring cups or graduated cylinders (for liquids).
  - Scraping tool (for red phosphorus collection).
  - Protective gear: Acid-resistant gloves, goggles, respirator, non-static clothing.
  - Ventilation setup (open area or crude fume hood substitute).
- **Optional**:
  - pH test strips (to monitor acidity, pH 2–12).
  - Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for analysis (unlikely in illicit settings).

## Synthesis Process (Street-Like Method)
1. **Extract Codeine from Tablets**:
   - Crush 100–500 codeine tablets (containing 80–400 mg codeine) into a fine powder using a mortar or improvised tool.
   - Mix the powder with 500 mL–1 L warm water (~40–50°C) or ethanol in a reaction vessel, stirring for 10–20 minutes to dissolve codeine and other soluble components (e.g., acetaminophen, caffeine).
   - Add 50–100 g sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to adjust pH to 10–12, precipitating codeine base while leaving impurities like acetaminophen in solution. Stir for 5–10 minutes.
   - Filter the mixture through filter paper or cloth to collect the crude codeine base precipitate. Wash with 100–200 mL cold water to remove residual NaOH.
   - Dissolve the precipitate in 500 mL–1 L gasoline or paint thinner, stirring for 10–15 minutes to extract codeine into the organic layer. Allow layers to separate, then decant the organic layer.
   - Add 100–200 mL hydrochloric acid (HCl) to the organic layer, shaking vigorously to form codeine hydrochloride in the aqueous layer. Separate the aqueous layer using a funnel or improvised separator. Evaporate water (<50°C) to yield crude codeine hydrochloride. Yield: ~50–300 mg codeine.

2. **Reduce Codeine to Desomorphine (Nagai Method)**:
   - In a reaction vessel, combine crude codeine hydrochloride with 50–100 g iodine and 10–50 g red phosphorus. Add 100–200 mL gasoline or paint thinner as a solvent.
   - Heat the mixture to 60–80°C with constant stirring for 30–45 minutes, generating hydriodic acid (HI) in situ from iodine and red phosphorus, which reduces codeine to desocodeine and subsequently demethylates it to desomorphine. Toxic fumes (e.g., nitrogen oxides, phosphine) are released; work in a well-ventilated area.
   - Cool the mixture to room temperature. Add 100–200 mL water and 50–100 g sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to adjust pH to 8–10, precipitating desomorphine base and other morphinans.
   - Filter the mixture to collect the precipitate, or extract into 500 mL–1 L gasoline/paint thinner. If extracted, separate the organic layer, add 50–100 mL HCl to form desomorphine hydrochloride, and evaporate the aqueous layer to yield a crude, light brown liquid or semi-solid. Yield: ~20–200 mg desomorphine (10–75% purity).

3. **Prepare Injectable Krokodil Solution**:
   - Dissolve the crude desomorphine product in 10–50 mL water or saline without further purification, forming a light brown, acidic suspension (pH often <3 due to residual HCl).
   - Optionally, add a pinch of sodium bicarbonate or cigarette ash to crudely neutralize acidity, though this is rarely effective. Do not filter, as illicit users typically inject the unrefined mixture.
   - Draw the suspension into syringes for intravenous use. The solution contains desomorphine, unreacted codeine, morphinan byproducts, iodine, phosphorus, and solvent residues.

## Storage and Handling
- Store krokodil liquid in syringes or small, non-static containers in a cool (<25°C), dark environment, though stability is poor due to impurities (use within hours).
- Handle with acid-resistant gloves, goggles, and a respirator to avoid exposure to corrosive residues (e.g., iodine, HCl). Avoid inhalation of toxic fumes during synthesis.
- Transport in sealed containers to prevent leaks, though illicit production rarely prioritizes safety.
- Avoid open flames or sparks near solvents (e.g., gasoline, paint thinner) due to extreme flammability.

## Notes
- **Purity**: Illicit krokodil is highly impure (desomorphine content: trace to 75%), containing toxic byproducts (e.g., iodinated morphinans, phosphorus compounds) and unreacted reagents. Pharmaceutical-grade desomorphine (historically Permonid) was ~98% pure, but illicit synthesis yields a complex, toxic mixture.
- **Hazards**: Krokodil causes severe tissue damage (necrosis, gangrene) due to impurities like iodine, red phosphorus, and acidic pH (<3). Gasoline and paint thinner residues are carcinogenic and neurotoxic. Synthesis releases toxic fumes (phosphine, nitrogen oxides). Work in a ventilated area with robust safety measures.
- **Efficiency**: Yield is ~25–50% from codeine due to crude methods and side reactions. Codeine quality and reagent purity significantly affect yield.
- **Scale**: Illicit production occurs in small batches (mg to g) in domestic settings, increasing risks of contamination and explosion. Large-scale synthesis is rare due to codeine restrictions.
- **Precursor Control**: Codeine is regulated in many regions (e.g., prescription-only in Russia since 2012), requiring black-market sourcing. Iodine and red phosphorus are also controlled in some areas.
- **Verification**: Illicit labs lack analytical tools; users rely on visual inspection (light brown liquid) or crude melting point tests (~189°C for pure desomorphine). GC-MS or HPLC confirms desomorphine and impurities in forensic settings.
- **Toxicity**: Krokodil’s short duration (1–2 hours) drives frequent injections, increasing risks of vein damage, infections (HIV, hepatitis C), and systemic toxicity. Mean survival time is ~2 years post-first use.
