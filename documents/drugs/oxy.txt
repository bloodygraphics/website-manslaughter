Oxycontin

# Step 1: Gather Precursors and Equipment
> Precursors:
  - Thebaine (extracted from opium or semi-synthetic sources)
  - Hydrogen peroxide (oxidizing agent)
  - Formic acid (for reduction)
  - Palladium on carbon (catalyst for hydrogenation)
  - Methylamine (optional, for side reactions)
  - Hydrochloric acid (for salting out)
  - Organic solvents (e.g., methanol, chloroform)
> Equipment:
  - Glassware (round-bottom flasks, condensers, separatory funnel)
  - Magnetic stirrer with hot plate
  - Fume hood (mandatory for ventilation)
  - Vacuum filtration setup (Buchner funnel, filter paper)
  - Rotary evaporator (for solvent removal)
  - pH meter or test strips

# Step 2: Oxidize Thebaine to 14-Hydroxycodeinone
> Process:
  - Dissolve 10g of thebaine in 50mL of methanol in a round-bottom flask.
  - Add 10mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide and 5mL of formic acid.
  - Stir at 40-50Â°C for 4 hours under reflux.
> Chemistry:
  - Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes thebaine to 14-hydroxycodeinone, adding a hydroxyl group.
  - Reaction: C19H21NO4 + H2O2 -> C19H21NO5
> Post-Reaction:
  - Cool mixture, neutralize with sodium bicarbonate (pH 7-8).
  - Extract with chloroform, dry over sodium sulfate, evaporate solvent.
  - Yield: ~75-85% of 14-hydroxycodeinone.

# Step 3: Hydrogenate to Oxycodone
> Reaction Setup:
  - Dissolve 10g of 14-hydroxycodeinone in 100mL of methanol.
  - Add 0.5g of palladium on carbon (5%) as catalyst.
  - Hydrogenate under 40-50 psi H2 pressure at room temperature for 6 hours.
> Chemistry:
  - Palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation reduces the double bond, forming oxycodone.
  - Reaction: C19H21NO5 + H2 -> C18H21NO4
> Post-Reaction:
  - Filter to remove palladium catalyst.
  - Evaporate methanol to obtain oxycodone freebase.
  - Yield: ~80-90% after filtration.

# Step 4: Convert to Oxycodone Hydrochloride
> Process:
  - Dissolve oxycodone freebase in 50mL of ethanol.
  - Add hydrochloric acid (diluted) dropwise until pH reaches 4-5.
  - Evaporate ethanol to precipitate oxycodone hydrochloride.
  - Filter and recrystallize in ethanol/ether for purity.
  - Yield: ~85% of oxycodone HCl from freebase.

# Step 5: Purification and Notes
> Purification:
  - Recrystallize oxycodone HCl in ethanol/ether to remove impurities.
  - Use column chromatography with chloroform/methanol if necessary.
> Notes:
  - Oxycodone HCl is the form used in OxyContin; freebase is less common.
  - Common impurities: unreacted 14-hydroxycodeinone, thebaine derivatives.
  - Thebaine is highly regulated; sourcing is a limiting factor.
> Safety:
  - Hydrogen peroxide is oxidative; handle with care.
  - Palladium on carbon is flammable; avoid sparks during filtration.
  - Solvents are flammable; work in fume hood.
