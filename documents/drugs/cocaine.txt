Cocaine

# Step 1: Gather Precursors and Equipment
> Precursors:
  - Tropinone (key intermediate, can be synthesized or purchased)
  - Methylamine (for reductive amination)
  - Benzoyl chloride (for benzoylation)
  - Sodium amalgam or lithium aluminum hydride (reducing agents)
  - Methanol (for esterification)
  - Hydrochloric acid (for salting out)
  - Organic solvents (e.g., diethyl ether, chloroform)
> Equipment:
  - Glassware (round-bottom flasks, condensers, separatory funnel)
  - Magnetic stirrer with hot plate
  - Fume hood (mandatory for ventilation)
  - Vacuum distillation setup
  - Filtration setup (Buchner funnel, filter paper)
  - Rotary evaporator (for solvent removal)

# Step 2: Synthesize Tropinone
> Process:
  - Combine succindialdehyde (10g), methylamine (5g), and acetonedicarboxylic acid (12g) in aqueous solution.
  - Adjust pH to 6-7 with sodium bicarbonate, stir at 40°C for 8 hours (Robinson tropinone synthesis).
  - Extract tropinone with chloroform, purify via vacuum distillation.
  - Yield: ~60-70% after purification.

# Step 3: Reductive Amination to Tropine
> Reaction Setup:
  - Dissolve tropinone (10g) in methanol (50mL).
  - Add sodium amalgam (15g) or lithium aluminum hydride (2g) under nitrogen atmosphere.
  - Stir at room temperature for 6 hours.
> Chemistry:
  - Reduction of tropinone ketone forms tropine alcohol.
  - Reaction: C8H13NO + H2 -> C8H15NO
> Post-Reaction:
  - Quench excess reducing agent with water (for Na amalgam) or dilute HCl (for LiAlH4).
  - Extract tropine with chloroform, dry over sodium sulfate, evaporate solvent.
  - Yield: ~80% after purification.

# Step 4: Esterification and Benzoylation to Cocaine
> Process:
  - Dissolve tropine (10g) in methanol (50mL), add methanol (5g) and sulfuric acid (catalyst).
  - Reflux for 4 hours to form methyl ecgonine.
  - Add benzoyl chloride (8g) in chloroform with triethylamine (5g) as base, stir at 0°C for 2 hours.
> Chemistry:
  - Esterification forms methyl ecgonine, followed by benzoylation to yield cocaine.
  - Reaction: C8H15NO + CH3OH -> C9H17NO2; C9H17NO2 + C7H5ClO -> C17H21NO4
> Post-Reaction:
  - Wash with water to remove triethylamine hydrochloride.
  - Extract cocaine freebase with chloroform.
  - Convert to cocaine HCl by adding HCl in ether, filter crystals.
  - Yield: ~65-75% after crystallization.

# Step 5: Purification and Notes
> Purification:
  - Recrystallize cocaine HCl in ethanol/ether for high purity.
  - Use column chromatography if impurities (e.g., unreacted tropine) persist.
> Notes:
  - Cocaine HCl is the common powder form; freebase is less stable.
  - Common impurities: ecgonine, benzoylecgonine.
  - Scale reactions carefully to avoid reagent waste.
> Safety:
  - Benzoyl chloride is corrosive; handle in fume hood.
  - Reducing agents are reactive; use dry conditions.
  - Solvents are flammable; avoid open flames.
