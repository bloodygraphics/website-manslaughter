Morphine

# Step 1: Gather Materials and Equipment
> Materials:
  - Raw opium (dried poppy latex, containing 10-20% morphine)
  - Thebaine (optional, for semi-synthetic route)
  - Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime)
  - Ammonium chloride (for precipitation)
  - Hydrochloric acid (for salting out)
  - Organic solvents (e.g., ethanol, chloroform)
> Equipment:
  - Glassware (beakers, separatory funnel, flasks)
  - Hot plate with magnetic stirrer
  - Fume hood (mandatory for ventilation)
  - Filtration setup (Buchner funnel, filter paper)
  - Rotary evaporator (for solvent removal)
  - pH meter or test strips

# Step 2: Extract Morphine from Opium
> Process:
  - Dissolve 100g of dried opium in 500mL of warm water (50°C).
  - Add 20g of calcium hydroxide, stir for 1 hour to form calcium morphenate.
  - Filter to remove insoluble plant material and other alkaloids.
  - Add ammonium chloride (10g) to the filtrate, adjust pH to 8-9, precipitating morphine base.
  - Filter and wash precipitate with cold water, dry thoroughly.
  - Yield: ~10-15g of crude morphine base (10-15% of opium mass).

# Step 3: Purify Morphine Base
> Process:
  - Dissolve crude morphine base in 100mL of dilute hydrochloric acid (pH 3-4).
  - Extract impurities with chloroform (discarding organic layer).
  - Basify aqueous layer with sodium hydroxide (pH 9-10) to re-precipitate morphine base.
  - Filter, wash with cold water, and dry.
  - Yield: ~80-90% of purified morphine base.

# Step 4: Convert to Morphine Hydrochloride
> Process:
  - Dissolve purified morphine base in 50mL of ethanol.
  - Add hydrochloric acid (diluted) dropwise until pH reaches 4-5.
  - Evaporate ethanol to precipitate morphine hydrochloride.
  - Recrystallize in ethanol/water for high purity.
  - Yield: ~85% of morphine HCl from base.

# Step 5: Alternative Semi-Synthetic Route from Thebaine
> Process:
  - Dissolve 10g of thebaine in 50mL of methanol with 5mL of formic acid.
  - Add 10mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide, stir at 40°C for 4 hours to form 14-hydroxycodeinone.
  - Hydrogenate with 0.5g palladium on carbon under 40 psi H2 for 6 hours to form oxycodone.
  - Demethylate oxycodone with boron tribromide (5g) in chloroform at 0°C for 2 hours.
  - Neutralize and extract morphine base with chloroform.
  - Convert to morphine HCl as in Step 4.
  - Yield: ~50-60% overall from thebaine.

# Step 6: Purification and Notes
> Purification:
  - Recrystallize morphine HCl in ethanol/water to remove impurities.
  - Use column chromatography with chloroform/methanol if necessary.
> Notes:
  - Morphine HCl is the common medicinal form; base is less stable.
  - Common impurities: codeine, papaverine (from opium route); oxycodone (from thebaine route).
  - Opium extraction is simpler but less controlled than semi-synthesis.
> Safety:
  - Opium and morphine are caustic; avoid skin contact.
  - Boron tribromide (semi-synthetic route) is highly reactive; handle in fume hood.
  - Solvents are flammable; avoid open flames.
