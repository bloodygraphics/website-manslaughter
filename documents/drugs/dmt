# Hypothetical Synthesis of DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine)

## Overview
DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine) is a potent psychedelic alkaloid found in various plants, such as Mimosa hostilis root bark. This document details a small-scale extraction process using the acid-base (A/B) extraction method to isolate DMT freebase from Mimosa hostilis, followed by crystallization. The process targets a yield suitable for personal use, with precise steps to maximize purity. All steps are hazardous, involving toxic, corrosive, and flammable substances, requiring meticulous handling in a controlled environment to prevent poisoning, fires, or explosions.

## Materials
- **Precursor Materials**:
  - Mimosa hostilis root bark (powdered): 50 g (contains ~1–2% DMT, yielding ~0.5–1 g).
- **Other Chemicals**:
  - Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, lye): 50–100 g for basification.
  - White vinegar (5% acetic acid) or hydrochloric acid (HCl, dilute): 100–200 mL for acidification.
  - Non-polar solvent (naphtha or heptane): 200–300 mL for DMT extraction.
  - Distilled water: 500–1000 mL for washing and dilution.
  - Acetone (optional): 50–100 mL for recrystallization.
  - Anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4): 10–20 g for drying organic layers.
- **Equipment**:
  - Glass or HDPE reaction vessel (1–2 L, acid/base-resistant).
  - Glass stirring rod or plastic spoon (non-reactive).
  - Separatory funnel (500 mL–1 L) or large glass jar for liquid-liquid extraction.
  - Funnel and filter paper (for crude filtration).
  - Hot plate or stove (for heating, <100°C).
  - pH meter or test strips (to monitor acidity/alkalinity, pH 2–14).
  - Vacuum filtration system (with fine mesh or filter paper).
  - Freezer (for freeze-precipitation, ~–20°C).
  - Glass petri dish or tray (for crystal collection).
  - Protective gear: Acid-resistant gloves, goggles, full-face respirator, non-static clothing.
  - Ventilation setup: Fume hood or well-ventilated area (mandatory for solvent vapors).
- **Optional**:
  - High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for purity analysis.

## Synthesis Process
1. **Acid Extraction of DMT from Mimosa Hostilis**:
   - In a 1–2 L reaction vessel, combine 50 g powdered Mimosa hostilis root bark with 500 mL distilled water and 100 mL white vinegar (or 50 mL dilute HCl) to achieve pH 2–4.
   - Heat the mixture to 50–60°C with stirring for 1–2 hours to extract DMT as its acetate or hydrochloride salt into the aqueous phase.
   - Filter the mixture through filter paper or cheesecloth to remove plant debris, collecting the acidic filtrate. Repeat the acid extraction with 200 mL fresh water/vinegar, combining filtrates. Yield: ~700–800 mL DMT-containing solution.

2. **Basification to Freebase DMT**:
   - Slowly add 50–100 g sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissolved in 100 mL water to the acidic filtrate, stirring continuously, until pH reaches 12–14. The solution will turn dark brown or black, and DMT will convert to its freebase form, which is insoluble in water.
   - Stir for 30–60 minutes to ensure complete basification. The mixture may heat up due to the exothermic reaction; allow it to cool to room temperature (~20–25°C).

3. **Extract DMT with Non-Polar Solvent**:
   - Add 50 mL naphtha (or heptane) to the basified solution in a separatory funnel or jar. Shake vigorously for 5–10 minutes, then allow layers to separate (naphtha will form the top layer, containing DMT freebase).
   - Decant or separate the naphtha layer into a clean glass container. Repeat the extraction with 50 mL fresh naphtha 3–4 times, combining all naphtha extracts. Yield: ~150–200 mL DMT-laden naphtha.
   - Dry the combined naphtha extracts with 10 g anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filter, and retain the clear naphtha solution.

4. **Crystallize DMT via Freeze-Precipitation**:
   - Place the naphtha solution in a glass container and seal tightly. Store in a freezer (~–20°C) for 12–24 hours to precipitate DMT freebase as white or yellowish crystals.
   - Decant the cold naphtha carefully (retaining it for potential re-extraction), leaving the DMT crystals in the container. Scrape the crystals onto a glass petri dish or tray.
   - Dry the crystals under a low fan or in a desiccator at room temperature for 2–4 hours to remove residual solvent. Yield: ~0.5–1 g DMT freebase (~90–95% purity).
   - Optionally, recrystallize by dissolving in 10 mL warm acetone (~40°C), filtering, and cooling to 0–5°C to form purer crystals. Yield: ~0.4–0.8 g after recrystallization.

## Storage and Handling
- Store DMT freebase in airtight, light-resistant, non-static containers (e.g., amber glass vials) in a cool (<25°C), dry environment or freezer (~–20°C) to prevent degradation.
- Handle with acid-resistant gloves, goggles, full-face respirator, and non-static clothing to avoid inhalation or skin absorption, as DMT is a potent psychedelic.
- Transport in sealed, padded containers to minimize shock or exposure to moisture.
- Avoid open flames or sparks near solvents (e.g., naphtha, acetone) due to high flammability.

## Notes
- **Purity**: Pure DMT is ~98–99% achieved via recrystallization and HPLC. Illicit extraction typically yields 90–95% purity, with impurities like plant alkaloids or residual solvent.
- **Hazards**: DMT causes intense psychological effects; improper dosing can lead to distress. Sodium hydroxide is highly corrosive; naphtha is flammable and toxic. Work in an explosion-proof fume hood or well-ventilated area with robust ventilation.
- **Efficiency**: Yield is ~1–2% from Mimosa hostilis (0.5–1 g DMT per 50 g bark) due to extraction losses. Bark quality and psilocybin content vary by source.
- **Scale**: This process targets a small batch (~0.5–1 g) for personal use. Scaling up increases risks and regulatory scrutiny.
- **Precursor Control**: Mimosa hostilis is legal in some regions but monitored in others (e.g., Australia, France). Naphtha and NaOH are widely available but may raise suspicion in large quantities.
- **Verification**: Illicit setups rely on visual inspection (white to yellowish crystals with a waxy texture) or melting point tests (~44–47°C for DMT freebase). HPLC or TLC confirms purity in forensic settings.
- **Appearance**: DMT freebase forms white to yellowish, waxy crystals with a distinct chemical odor, often described as "plastic-like."
