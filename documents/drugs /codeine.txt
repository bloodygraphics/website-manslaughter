Codeine

# Step 1: Gather Precursors and Equipment
> Precursors:
  - Morphine (base material, derived from opium or semi-synthetic sources)
  - Dimethyl sulfate or methyl iodide (methylating agents)
  - Sodium hydroxide (for base reactions)
  - Hydrochloric acid (for salting out)
  - Organic solvents (e.g., chloroform, ethanol)
> Equipment:
  - Glassware (round-bottom flasks, condensers, separatory funnel)
  - Magnetic stirrer with hot plate
  - Fume hood (mandatory for ventilation)
  - Filtration setup (Buchner funnel, filter paper)
  - Rotary evaporator (for solvent removal)
  - pH meter or test strips

# Step 2: Prepare Morphine Base
> Process:
  - Dissolve 10g of morphine sulfate or hydrochloride in 50mL of distilled water.
  - Add sodium hydroxide solution (10%) to adjust pH to 9-10, precipitating morphine freebase.
  - Filter and wash precipitate with cold water, dry thoroughly.
  - Yield: ~90% of morphine base from starting material.

# Step 3: Methylation to Codeine
> Reaction Setup:
  - Dissolve morphine base (10g) in 100mL of dry ethanol in a round-bottom flask.
  - Add methyl iodide (5g) or dimethyl sulfate (4g) dropwise under nitrogen atmosphere.
  - Reflux at 70Â°C for 6 hours with stirring.
> Chemistry:
  - Methylation of the phenolic hydroxyl group on morphine forms codeine.
  - Reaction: C17H19NO3 + CH3I -> C18H21NO3 + HI
> Post-Reaction:
  - Cool mixture, neutralize excess methylating agent with dilute sodium hydroxide.
  - Extract codeine freebase with chloroform, dry over sodium sulfate, evaporate solvent.
  - Yield: ~70-80% after extraction.

# Step 4: Conversion to Codeine Phosphate
> Process:
  - Dissolve codeine freebase in 50mL of ethanol.
  - Add phosphoric acid (85%, diluted) dropwise until pH reaches 4-5.
  - Evaporate ethanol to precipitate codeine phosphate.
  - Filter and recrystallize in ethanol/water for purity.
  - Yield: ~85% of codeine phosphate from freebase.

# Step 5: Purification and Notes
> Purification:
  - Recrystallize codeine phosphate in ethanol/water to remove impurities.
  - Use column chromatography with chloroform/methanol if necessary.
> Notes:
  - Codeine phosphate is the common medicinal form; freebase is less stable.
  - Common impurities: unreacted morphine, O6-methylmorphine.
  - Methyl iodide is preferred for cleaner reactions; dimethyl sulfate is more hazardous.
> Safety:
  - Methylating agents are toxic and carcinogenic; handle in fume hood.
  - Morphine is caustic; avoid skin contact.
  - Solvents are flammable; avoid open flames.
